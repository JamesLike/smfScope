## The smfBox
Single molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) can be used to obtain a unique level of information specifically for dynamic processes involving biological molecules. The Craggs group of The University of Sheffield has developed an open-source microscopy platform for making smFRET measurements at a fraction of the price of typical commercial systems. The smfBox system can be built for around 50,000 GBP using commercially available parts and fabrication of a simple microscope body. 

This webpage presents a modular platform based on a confocal system offering high stabilty, flexibility and a compact design.
